Hi Professor, I apologize for making this grading harder for you. I tried my best!
The last commit won't work well but it would have the templates for the party which you can find under drinkz/templates. A commit to see the changes is the one with the message "done with part of 6-2, finished the class and db" My problem was that I didn't really change everything into sql so the load function was working and creating the dictionaries so I though it was working until I found that I am not in a good situation. Also I still didn't figure out a way to bulk load everything into the databases. Sorry again. Thank you for the great semester
